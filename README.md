# Character Count Generator

This Python program generates a count of each character in a given sentence, ignoring spaces and considering case insensitively.

## Introduction

The Character Count Generator is a simple Python program that takes a sentence as input and provides a count of each unique character present in the sentence, ignoring spaces. The program treats uppercase and lowercase characters as equivalent, providing a case-insensitive count.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:** Clone the repository or download the `character_count_generator.py` file directly to your local machine.

2. **Run the program:** Execute the program using Python by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    python character_count_generator.py
    ```

3. **Enter a sentence:** Input a sentence when prompted. The program will then generate a count of each character in the sentence, ignoring spaces and considering case insensitively.

## Example

Suppose you enter the sentence `Hello, World!`. Here's how the output will look:

```
Enter a sentence: Hello, World!
The letter h is repeated 1 times
The letter e is repeated 1 times
The letter l is repeated 3 times
The letter o is repeated 2 times
The letter , is repeated 1 times
The letter w is repeated 1 times
The letter r is repeated 1 times
The letter d is repeated 1 times
The letter ! is repeated 1 times
```
